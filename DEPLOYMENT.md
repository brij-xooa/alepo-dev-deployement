# WP Engine Git Push Deployment Guide

## üöÄ Quick Start Deployment

### 1. Initialize Git Repository
```bash
cd "/mnt/d/Website Works/alepo-dryrun"
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial Alepo theme commit"
```

### 2. Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to GitHub.com
2. Create new repository: `alepo-theme-deployment`
3. **Don't** initialize with README (we already have one)
4. Copy the repository URL

### 3. Connect to GitHub
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/alepo-theme-deployment.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### 4. Configure WP Engine Git Push

**In WP Engine User Portal:**
1. Go to your development environment
2. Navigate to "Git Push" section
3. Click "Enable Git Push"
4. Add your SSH public key
5. Copy the Git remote URL (looks like: `git@git.wpengine.com:production/yoursitename.git`)

### 5. Add WP Engine Remote
```bash
git remote add wpengine git@git.wpengine.com:production/yourdevsite.git
```

### 6. Deploy to WP Engine
```bash
git push wpengine main
```

## üîÑ Ongoing Development Workflow

   git commit -m "Description of changes"
   git push origin main

### Branch Strategy (Recommended)
```bash

```

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Deployment Issues

**1. Permission Denied (SSH)**
- Check SSH key is added to WP Engine
- Verify key format (should be RSA or Ed25519)
- Test SSH connection: `ssh -T git@git.wpengine.com`

**2. Pages Not Created**
- Check WordPress admin user permissions
- Verify ACF Pro is installed and activated
- Try running script via WP-CLI instead of browser

**3. Theme Not Activating**
- Check `style.css` has proper theme header
- Verify all PHP files have no syntax errors
- Check WP Engine error logs

**4. ACF Fields Not Showing**
- Ensure ACF Pro plugin is activated
- Check that `functions.php` loaded without errors
- Verify field group registration in ACF admin

### WP Engine Specific Notes

**File Permissions:**
- WP Engine manages file permissions automatically
- Page creation scripts include proper permission checks

**Cache Clearing:**
- WP Engine auto-clears cache on Git deployment
- Manual cache clear: WP Engine User Portal ‚Üí Utilities ‚Üí Cache

**Environment Variables:**
- Use WP Engine environment detection if needed
- Check `WPE_APIKEY` for environment identification

# Design Notes: AAA Solutions Page

## Visual Concept
This page uses a **"Authentication Storm"** theme - visualizing the challenge of handling massive authentication loads with weather metaphors and dynamic visuals.

### Color Palette
- Primary: Deep blue gradient (#0056b3 to #17a2b8) - representing trust and reliability
- Accent: Electric blue (#00d4ff) - for interactive elements and counters
- Warning: Amber (#ffc107) - for legacy system pain points
- Success: Green (#28a745) - for Alepo solution benefits

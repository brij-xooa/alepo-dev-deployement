**End-to-End Partner:** Unlike many point-solution vendors, Alepo delivers a holistic solution stack covering network access (AAA), business support systems (BSS/charging), and customer engagement (AI self-care and support). This breadth, combined with 24/7/365 technical support and managed services, allows Alepo to be a one-stop partner for digital telco transformation.

In summary, Alepo's positioning is that of a future-ready, digital enablement provider for telecom operators. Its focus is on three key solution pillars – AAA infrastructure, digital BSS, and AI-powered customer experience – which together drive operational efficiency, innovative services, and superior customer engagement for telcos.

## Pillar 1: AAA Solutions (Authentication, Authorization, Accounting)

Alepo's heritage and continued strength lies in its carrier-grade AAA (Authentication, Authorization, Accounting) server – a critical network element that controls subscriber access to services and enforces policies across broadband and telecom networks. Alepo's AAA is an industry-leading platform built for wireline, WiFi, and 3GPP mobile networks alike. It serves as an intelligent framework for service authentication and policy control in IP-based networks, helping operators optimize network performance, secure access, and monetize new services.

### Capabilities and Features

Alepo AAA supports all major AAA protocols and standards, providing broad compatibility and advanced functionality:

**RADIUS and Diameter Support:** The server runs a dual-stack AAA framework, simultaneously handling RADIUS (commonly used in Wi-Fi, broadband) and Diameter (for 4G/5G mobile core) on one platform. This allows one unified AAA system to serve across fixed, wireless, and mobile networks, reducing integration complexity and cost. Alepo's AAA also implements standard 3GPP interfaces and protocols for seamless interworking with various network elements (e.g. PGW/UPF, policy nodes, HSS) and supports modern use cases like VoWiFi (Wi-Fi calling) and 5G slice authentication.

**TACACS+ for Device Administration:** In addition to subscriber AAA, Alepo's solution incorporates TACACS+ capabilities to authenticate and authorize administrative access to network routers, switches, and other edge devices. This centralizes and secures network management, ensuring only authorized personnel can execute changes – a feature often missing in basic AAA servers.

**High Performance & Scalability:** Alepo AAA is designed for carrier-grade performance, achieving five-nines (99.999%) availability and extremely high throughput. The stateless, distributed architecture supports horizontal scaling to handle millions of subscribers with industry-leading transaction rates (benchmarked at ~36,000 Transactions Per Second with sub-millisecond latency). Built-in load balancing, clustering, and self-healing ensure consistent performance as networks grow, and an emergency "standalone" mode keeps services running even if external databases fail.

**Real-Time Policy Control and Charging Integration:** The AAA server not only authenticates users but can enforce real-time service policies in concert with charging systems. For example, it enables instant quota checks and adjustments (using Diameter Gy/DCCA for credit-control), supports real-time bandwidth boosts or throttling, and triggers alerts or captive portal redirects for certain conditions. This means operators can launch innovative prepaid plans, turbo-boost add-ons, or fair usage policies with zero revenue leakage and without needing a separate PCRF module.

**Security and Fraud Management:** The AAA system includes features to mitigate fraud and network abuse. It can detect and filter signaling "noise" from authentication failures or malicious login attempts, safeguarding network resources. By eliminating authentication loops or rogue requests, Alepo AAA effectively increases network capacity and quality of service for legitimate traffic. Role-based access control and robust logging are provided for auditability.

**Flexible Integration and Network-Agnostic Deployment:** A key strength of Alepo's AAA is its proven integration framework and network-agnostic design. It offers a rich set of APIs (REST and SOAP) and supports standard protocols to integrate with OSS/BSS, subscriber databases, and multi-vendor network equipment. This interoperability eliminates vendor lock-in – the AAA works with any broadband network gateway or 5G core and can be deployed in public cloud (AWS, Azure, GCP), private cloud, or on-premises data centers according to the operator's needs.

### Benefits and Use Cases

By upgrading to Alepo's AAA platform, service providers realize significant operational and business benefits:

**Optimized Network Performance:** A robust AAA framework maximizes utilization of network resources and ensures high Quality of Service even under heavy load. Alepo's AAA speeds up authentication transactions and eliminates bottlenecks, which is especially crucial as broadband usage and device connections grow exponentially. This leads to faster subscriber connection times, fewer drops, and an overall better customer internet experience.

**Scalability and Future-Readiness:** The platform's dynamic scalability means operators can support ever-increasing bandwidth demands and subscriber growth without performance degradation. It is fully 5G-ready, supporting new authentication use cases like network slicing and private 5G access, as well as non-3GPP access authentication for converged Wi-Fi/cellular offerings.

**Streamlined Operations:** Alepo AAA features an intuitive web-based management portal and centralized configuration management across all AAA nodes. Administrative tasks that were cumbersome on legacy AAA are greatly simplified. Moreover, a built-in scripting engine lets operators implement custom business rules or integrations without altering source code, enabling faster rollout of new requirements.

**Monetization of Advanced Services:** Beyond basic network access, Alepo's AAA opens doors to new revenue-generating services. It supports scenarios like WiFi offload with mobile core integration, WiFi Calling authentication for IMS/VoWiFi, and dynamic prepaid top-ups or bandwidth boosts purchased on the fly. The AAA's real-time hooks into charging and its rich logging/analytics help operators create personalized offers and upsell customers based on actual usage patterns.

### Competitive Positioning (AAA)

In the AAA space, Alepo distinguishes itself from both open-source alternatives and legacy vendor solutions:

**Versus Open-Source AAA:** Many smaller ISPs begin with free AAA servers (like FreeRADIUS), but these often struggle to scale and lack advanced features. Alepo's AAA offers vastly superior scalability, reliability, and support – it's a mature platform tested in Tier-1 environments, with built-in high-availability and clustering that open-source AAA typically lacks. Importantly, Alepo provides 24/7 professional support and ongoing development for its AAA, whereas open-source users must rely on in-house effort or community support.

**Versus Legacy Proprietary AAA:** Some incumbent telecom vendors provide AAA as part of a larger core network suite, but those systems can be inflexible (tied to that vendor's equipment) or nearing end-of-life. Alepo positions its AAA as a vendor-neutral, modern replacement for legacy AAA platforms that are due for refresh. The product's support for multi-vendor networks and standards means an operator can replace legacy AAA without disrupting other elements.

## Pillar 2: Digital BSS Solutions (Business Support Systems)

Alepo provides a comprehensive Digital BSS (Business Support System) suite that enables telecom operators to manage all aspects of service delivery, monetization, and customer lifecycle in a convergent, digital-first manner. Alepo's BSS is an evolution of traditional billing and OSS/BSS systems, rebuilt as a modular, cloud-native platform that supports modern telco business models and prioritizes customer experience.
